## Spectral Hyperresolution

This repository brings [Sparse time-frequency representations](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0601707103) by Timothy J. Gardner and Marcelo O. Magnasco to the Python world.

To quote the paper:

> Many details of complex sounds that are virtually undetectable in standard sonograms are readily perceptible and visible in reassignment

The idea we would like to explore is the application of the novel linear reassignment technique to downstream tasks (audio classification, unsupervised machine translation, etc). The hope is that this richer representation can lead to improved performance.

### Useful resources

* [Instructions on configuring Jupyter Notebook to work with Matlab](https://am111.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jmatlab_install.html) - this is not required to run Python examples, but necessary if you would like to run the NB that uses the Matlab kernel
* [A Compact Primer On Digital Signal Processing](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/index.html) - if you are new to DSP, this is a very gentle introduction (with a lot of links to additional materials), great interactive visualizations, definitely worth checking out
